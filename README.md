## Overview

Codelingo is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that helps software development teams produce better software, faster - together. It treats **your software as data** and **automates your workflows**, called Flows, with the rules and patterns you define, called Tenets.

Our flagship Flow is the Review Flow, which checks a repository's pull requests conform to its project specific patterns.



## Quick Start

```bash
# Run this command from anywhere. Follow the prompts to set up Codelingo on your machine.
$ lingo config setup

# Run this command to add a default .lingo.yaml file in the current directory.
$ lingo init

# Add a Tenet to the .lingo.yaml file (see https://codelingo.io/docs/concepts/tenets/#writing-custom-tenets for more info). This will be used by the following command to run a review.
$ lingo run review

```

## Slow Start

Follow the [step by step guide](https://www.codelingo.io/docs/getting-started/) to getting started with the lingo tool.
